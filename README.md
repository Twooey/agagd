## AGAGD - the American Go Association Games Database

The AGAGD is a django web application ported from the EuroGo Games Database to Python that provides:
* member information, 
* top tournaments listings,
* top players listings,
* top active players,
* insights into current and past tournaments.

## Contributing

We welcome and encourage contributions to the AGAGD with Pull Requests (PRs), feature requests, bug reports, etc. 

## Database Prerequisites

Contributors submitting Pull Requests (PRs) may notice some difficulty in running a local Docker configuration. That is due to changes which now require a current dump of the AGAGD database schema  which is not available publically. If you are interested in contributing and would like access to the database schema, contact [Steve Colburn](mailto:steve.colburn@usgo.org).
